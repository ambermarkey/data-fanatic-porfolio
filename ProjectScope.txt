# Project Title: Medical Insurance Analysis
## 1. Problem Description
Insurance is costly and there are a number of factors that go into determining a person's insurance rates. The insurance industry uses a dataset to determine appropriate costs. For fair rates, datasets should include equal representation across all groups.

## 2. Goals
The overall goal of this analysis is to understand the equality of the data. Since the dataset I am operating from is limited, the goal of this analysis is to open up the conversation of equality in insurance rates. 

## 3. Data Source
The source of the data is from CodeAcademy and the CDC (BMI breakdown). The dataset includes insurance costs for United States adults aged 19 - 64 and includes information on BMI, region of the US, number of children, and smoking status. Additional sources of data for future analyses could include:
* Medicare/CMS datasets
* Private insurance rate information

## 4. Analysis
In this analysis, I am seeking to quantify the quality of the data provided by the medical insurance industry: 
* What is the representation of males and females in the dataset? 
* What is the representation of each, broken down by the following:
    * Number of Children
    * By Age Group
    * By Region
    * By Smoking Status
* What is the average insurance rate for each group, broken down by Region?

I plan to break the data down into groups by the following, where each range is UP TO that number:
* Age Range:
    * {'Age': {1: 24, 2: 29, 3: 34, 4: 39, 5: 44, 6: 49, 7: 54, 8: 59, 9: 64}}
* Number of Children:
    * {'Children' : {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 3, 5: 4, 6: 5}}
* BMI:
    * {'BMI': {'underweight': 18.5, 'Healthy': 24.9, 'Overweight': 29.9}} Obese = 30.0 and above
* Region:
    * {'Region': {1: 'Northeast, 2: 'Southeast', 3: 'Northwest', 4: 'Southwest'}}

The dataset has been pre-cleaned and contains no null or invalid values. Therefore, there are no concerns with the integrity of the data used, assuming the cleaning process by CodeAcademy preserved the integrity.
